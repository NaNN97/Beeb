ast - abstract syntax tree

If you would like to make any changes to beeb.ne parser file, you would need to run
a command called:
npm run gen-parser

This will run exactly this command which is defined in package.json file - nearleyc beeb.ne -o beeb.js"
Nearley will take "beeb.ne" file which is the grammar file that has set of rules.
This will generate file called "beeb.js".

To parse an example file enter below command in a console figuratively changing "ex1.beeb" to "ex2.beeb" etc.
depending on which example you want to run:
node parse.js ex1.beeb

This will generate abstract syntax tree file ".ast" from that source ".beeb" file.

Once that is done you can run the following command:
node generate.js ex1.ast

This will generate javascript source code file of our "ex1.ast" file.

There is also a "run.js" file which creates both ".ast" as well as ".js" file from source ".beeb" file.
It also returns the result of any "print()" function from the ".beeb" file in the console.
